# archeryMontyCarlo

If you run monty.py, it will run a monty carlo simulation of an archery game (assuming no skill), and result in an example, such as seen in Figure_1. 

In terms of the accuracy of such a simulation, it is more accurate to run it radially. This project was mentally completed by me before I thought that keeping the code that does it radially is valuable, so it is not here. 
The reason why I say this, is that in an archery game you are trying to aim at the gold, in one way or another. So it's more accurate to have a radial representation for medium levels of skill. 
The current representation in figure 1 doesn't create random points radially, but alone the two axes. It's not a large change, just using a radius from a centre point and an angle. Realistically the angle doesn't matter for the distribution but makes it more apparent seeing it around the centre instead of one line going in one direction. If I ever get back to this project, I shall implement this functionality.
